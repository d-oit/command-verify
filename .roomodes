      === COMMAND DETECTION PRINCIPLES ===
      
      Always prioritize these principles when working with command detection:
      1. **Precision over recall** - Better to miss a command than falsely identify non-commands
      2. **Context awareness** - Consider markdown structure, code blocks, and inline code context
      3. **Platform diversity** - Account for Windows (cmd/powershell), Unix (bash/zsh), and cross-platform tools
      4. **Documentation vs reality** - Distinguish between documentation examples and actual executable commands
      
      === PATTERN DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES ===
      
      When creating new command detection patterns:
      - Test against real documentation files
      - Include comprehensive edge case coverage
      - Validate against false positive scenarios
      - Consider performance implications for large file processing
      - Maintain backward compatibility with existing patterns
      
      === TESTING REQUIREMENTS ===
      
      All command detection changes must include:
      - Positive test cases for valid commands
      - Negative test cases for non-commands
      - Edge case scenarios (empty input, malformed content)
      - Cross-platform compatibility tests
      - Performance benchmarks for large files
      
      === INTEGRATION KNOWLEDGE ===
      
      Understand how command detection integrates with:
      - Command extraction from markdown (lib/command-extraction.js)
      - Command categorization system (lib/command-categorization.js)
      - Knowledge base learning system (lib/knowledge-base.js)
      - Cache invalidation strategies
      - Git diff analysis

    customInstructions: |-
      === SAFETY CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK ===
      
      Use this hierarchy when categorizing commands:
      1. **DANGEROUS** - Never auto-execute, high risk of data loss or system damage
         Examples: rm -rf, git push --force, drop database, format commands
      2. **CONDITIONAL** - Requires user confirmation, moderate risk
         Examples: npm install, docker build, git commit, package operations
      3. **SAFE** - Can auto-execute, minimal risk
         Examples: git status, version checks, read-only operations
      4. **SKIP** - Documentation examples, not real commands
         Examples: /verify, placeholder commands, documentation artifacts
      5. **UNKNOWN** - Insufficient information for classification
      
      === KNOWLEDGE BASE INTEGRATION ===
      
      Knowledge base rules take precedence over hardcoded patterns:
      - Load .claude/knowledge.json for project-specific rules
      - Support exact matches and regex patterns
      - Allow rule overrides for special cases
      - Maintain learning history and adaptation
      - Validate regex patterns for security
      
      === CONFIDENCE SCORING ===
      
      Assign confidence scores based on:
      - Pattern match specificity (exact = 1.0, regex = 0.95)
      - Knowledge base authority vs. heuristics
      - Command complexity and ambiguity
      - Cross-platform consistency
      - Historical accuracy data
      
      === SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ===
      
      Always consider:
      - Privilege escalation potential
      - Data destruction capabilities
      - Network exposure risks
      - Resource consumption impact
      - Social engineering possibilities
      - Platform-specific vulnerabilities

      === CACHE DESIGN PRINCIPLES ===
      
      Follow these caching principles:
      1. **Intelligent Invalidation** - Only invalidate what actually changed
      2. **Minimal I/O** - Reduce file system operations
      3. **Fast Lookups** - Use efficient data structures for cache access
      4. **Memory Efficiency** - Balance cache size with memory usage

      === QUALITY ASSURANCE ===
      
      Maintain knowledge base quality:
      - Validate regex patterns for security and correctness
      - Prevent circular dependencies in rules
      - Ensure rule priority consistency
      - Track learning effectiveness metrics
      - Provide knowledge base rollback capabilities
      
      === PORTABILITY STANDARDS ===
      
      Design for cross-project compatibility:
      - Use generic JSON format (no proprietary extensions)
      - Support partial knowledge base merging
      - Maintain backward compatibility
      - Include metadata for knowledge provenance
      - Support knowledge base versioning
