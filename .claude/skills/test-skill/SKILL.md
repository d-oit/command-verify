# Test Skill

## Overview

This is a simple demonstration skill that analyzes the project structure and provides basic statistics. It's designed to test Claude Code's skill invocation system.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user asks to:
- "Analyze the code structure"
- "Give me project statistics"
- "Count the files in this project"
- "Show me a code summary"
- "Use the test skill"

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Count Files**
   - Use Glob to find all code files: `**/*.{js,ts,py,rs,go,java}`
   - Use Glob to find all markdown files: `**/*.md`
   - Count the results

2. **Analyze Structure**
   - List the top-level directories (excluding node_modules, .git, dist, build)
   - Note any configuration files found

3. **Generate Report**
   - Present findings in a clear, structured format
   - Include:
     - Total code files by extension
     - Total markdown files
     - Top-level directories
     - Key configuration files detected

4. **Add Skill Marker**
   - At the end of the report, add: "✓ Generated by test-skill"
   - This confirms the skill was properly invoked

## Example Output

```

## Safety

This skill only reads files and directories - it never modifies anything. All operations are safe.
