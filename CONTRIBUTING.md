### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Create a branch** from `main` for your work
2. **Keep PRs focused** - one feature or fix per PR
3. **Test thoroughly** - ensure all tests pass
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Add screenshots** for UI changes (if applicable)
6. **Follow the PR template** (see below)

## Testing

### Automated Testing

```bash

npm run verify

# Run specific test scenarios
# (Add your test commands here)
```

### Manual Testing

Test these scenarios:

1. **Fresh installation**: Delete `.cache/` and run verification
2. **Cache invalidation**: Modify a .md file and verify cache updates
3. **Git integration**: Test with different git states
4. **Error handling**: Test with missing dependencies, invalid files
5. **Performance**: Time execution with large documentation sets

### Test Documentation

When adding new features, include:

- Test cases in code comments
- Manual testing instructions
- Expected behavior documentation
